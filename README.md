# 🧠 LLM Debate Agent

> A multi-agent reasoning system that debates complex questions, evaluates arguments, and produces more reliable, explainable AI outputs.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Large Language Models (LLMs) often:
- Produce confident but incorrect answers
- Struggle with controversial or subjective questions
- Provide single-perspective reasoning
- Lack transparent evaluation of their own responses

For decision-making, learning, and analysis, a single LLM response is not enough.  
Users need balanced reasoning, counter-arguments, and measurable confidence.

## 💡Solution

The **LLM Debate Agent** is a **multi-agent architecture** where multiple LLMs debate a topic from opposing perspectives, followed by an independent evaluation agent that scores and synthesizes the final answer.

Instead of asking *“What is the answer?”*, we ask:

> “What are the strongest arguments **for**, **against**, and which one actually holds up?”
